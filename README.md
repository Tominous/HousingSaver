# HousingSaver
Run a Parkour or Maze house in Hypixel Housing where it is critical that users are able to save their location? Using this mod allows users to automatically save their position using chat commands.

Please keep in mind that at the moment, users must /msg the user running the Minecraft mod in order for it to work (i.e. `/msg bugfroggy !save`).

### Planned Features
* Customizable save trigger
* Manually save players positions via command
* Double check your location before responding to save requests
* Toggleable timed announcements, reminding users they can do !save
* Have a !save cooldown
