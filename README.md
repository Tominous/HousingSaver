# HousingSaver
Run a Parkour or Maze house in Hypixel Housing where it is critical that users are able to save their location? Using this mod allows users to automatically save their position using chat commands.

Please keep in mind that by default, users must /msg the user running the Minecraft mod in order for it to work (i.e. `/msg bugfroggy !save`). This can be changed in the Mod configuration.

### Planned Features
* Manually save players positions via command
* Double check your location before responding to save requests
* Toggleable timed announcements, reminding users they can do !save
* Have a !save cooldown

### Download
